<h1>Hi there ðŸ‘‹,</h1>

<p align="justify">I'm Daniel, and I've been working in the software development field since 2016. Over the years, I've had the opportunity to work in various industries, including finance, travel, and education. For the most part, I've been focused on backend development, using Java and Spring Boot to create robust and efficient systems.</p>

<p align="justify">Since 2022, I've expanded my skill set and started working as a full-stack developer. This transition has allowed me to work on both the server and client sides of applications, and I've particularly enjoyed working with Angular for front-end development.</p>

<p align="justify">In addition to my practical work, I'm passionate about software architecture. I believe that building solid, scalable, and maintainable software is essential for long-term success. As such, I've been actively studying software architecture principles and best practices.</p>

<p align="justify">Currently, I call Europe my home. Living here has not only provided me with a rich cultural experience but also the opportunity to work on diverse and interesting projects.</p>

<p align="justify">I'm always eager to learn and grow in this ever-evolving field, and I'm excited about the future possibilities that technology and software development have to offer.</p>
